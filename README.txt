This is the stuff that Soren Gust did over the years for the Videopac/Odyssey.
Unfortunately, it's missing the slideshow code for the Videopac G4700+ !

The slideshow was here :

Archive.org strangely archived everything except this file...

Lemme know if you have a copy of it ! (or if i can contact Soren...)
