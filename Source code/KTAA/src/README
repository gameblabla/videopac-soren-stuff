This is the source code to KTAA, a video console game for the Odyssey^2,
Videopac G7000 and Videopac+ G7400 game consoles. It uses all 4 banks with 3K
code in every bank, all the address space that is available without additional
address decoding.

This is only useful for experienced Videopac programmers.

I wrote KTAA using asl version 1.41r8, see <http://www.alfsembler.de>. I use
several special features (macros, section) of asl, so using other assemblers
requires a lot of porting. To rebuild the graphic include files you need perl,
I used version 5.6.1.

The code is not as good documented as my normal example code. I inserted
some explanations where I thought they were necessary, see the comments
containing "NOTE:", but they were mostly written to help me re-understand
my own code.

Code execution starts in bank 3 for non-plus machines and in bank 1 for
Videopac+ G7400 machines. The file ktaa_b3.a48 contains additional information
about the program structure.

There are lots of data structures describing the levels, targets and alien
combinations, they are distributed between several banks. If you change one of
them others have to be adapted to reflect the changes done into the first one.
Designing other levels is not an easy task.

There are some assemble-time defines to enable cheat modes:

CHEAT_LEVEL 	Press the keys 1-7 on the level screen to set the next level.
CHEAT_TARGETS	The game continues even if all targets are shot by the aliens.
CHEAT_SHIELD	The shield always has full power.

There are several parameters which can be changed in common.h, some of them
affect the timing, be careful when changing them, the whole timing is quite
fragile.

There are also some DEBUG_ defines I used while debugging. Not all of them
lead to working code due to page misalignments.
