To create a KTAA cartridge it is necessary to open any old Videopac or
Odyssey^2 cartridge and replace the ROM. You can either build a completely
new PCB (see http://soeren.informationstheater.de/g7000/cart.html) or reuse
the old one after removing the screening metal and ROM.

How to create a KTAA cart from an old Videopac 2K game:

I assume in this text here that you have some knowledge about EPROMs and
how they are connected to Processors. KTAA does use all address lines
available, so you have to reroute some pins (commercial carts leave out
A10). The EPROM also has more pins than the ROMs used in commercial carts,
but most of the pins are compatible.

How to burn the 27C128 EPROM from the O2EM rom file:
KTAA needs all available address space, so it can't just leave 1K per bank
unused as most commercial games do. The commercial games leave out A10 of
the processor, so that the ROM is mirrored. To use the full address space
all address lines of the processor have to be connected 1:1. This also
means that the lower 1K of every bank is unaccessable as the internal BIOS
sits there. So to convert the 12K O2EM image to a 16K EPROM file you have to
insert 1K empty space before every 3K. So the memory map of the EPROM looks
like:

0000h-03ffh empty
0400h-0fffh first 3K block from O2EM image file
1000h-13ffh empty
1400h-1fffh second 3K block from O2EM image file
2000h-23ffh empty
2400h-2fffh third 3K block from O2EM image file
3000h-33ffh empty
3400h-3fffh last 3K block from O2EM image file

Cart Slot pinout numbering, looking into the slot on the machine:
Back row:  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  J  K  L  M  N  P  R (I and O not used)
Front row: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15

How to connect the 27C128 EPROM to the Videopac / O^2:
 1 VCP	D
 2 A12	13
 3 A7	N
 4 A6	P
 5 A5	M
 6 A4	L
 7 A3	K
 8 A2	J
 9 A1	H
10 A0	G
11 D0	2
12 D1	3
13 D2	4
14 GND	C
15 D3	5
16 D4	6
17 D5	7
18 D6	8
19 D7	9
20 /CE	C
21 A10	10
22 /G	F
23 A11	14
24 A9	15
25 A8	R
26 A13	12
27 /PGM	D
28 VCC	D

Cart slot pin B must not be connected for KTAA, otherwise there is no black
border around the ground on Videopac+ machines. On most carts (all that
don't use The Voice) pin B is connected to pin C.

On the Videopac 1 pcb which I converted I had to reroute the EPROM pins
1, 2, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28.

Don't use sockets on ceramic EPROMS, they are too high, the enclosure will
not fit any more.
